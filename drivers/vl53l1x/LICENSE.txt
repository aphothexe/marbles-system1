provided by ST (STSW-IMG007), and some of the explanatory comments are quoted
or paraphrased from the API source code, API user manual (UM2356), and VL53L1X
datasheet. Therefore, the license terms for the API source code (BSD 3-clause
"New" or "Revised" License) also apply to this derivative work, as specified
