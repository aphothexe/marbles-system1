## About Badger 2040 W

Badger 2040 W is a programmable E Paper/eInk/EPD badge with 2.4GHz wireless connectivity, powered by Raspberry Pi Pico W. It can go into a deep sleep mode between updates to preserve battery.

Badger 2040 W ships with MicroPython firmware pre-loaded, but you can download the most recent version at the link below (you'll want the  `pimoroni-badger2040w` .uf2). If you download the `-with-examples` file, it will come with examples built in.

## Badger 2040 W and PicoGraphics

The easiest way to start displaying cool stuff on Badger is by using our `badger2040w` module (which contains helpful functions for interacting with the board hardware) and our PicoGraphics library (which contains a bunch of functions for drawing on the E Ink display).
