## About Galactic Unicorn

Galactic Unicorn offers 53x11 bright RGB LEDs driven by Pico W's PIO in addition to a 1W amplifier + speaker, a collection of system and user buttons, and two Qw/ST connectors for adding external sensors and devices. Woha!

## Galactic Unicorn and PicoGraphics

The easiest way to start displaying cool stuff on Galactic Unicorn is using our Galactic Unicorn module (which contains a bunch of helpful functions for interacting with the buttons, adjusting brightness and suchlike) and our PicoGraphics library, which is chock full of useful functions for drawing on the LED matrix.

## Examples

### Clock

[clock.py](clock.py)

Clock example with (optional) NTP synchronization. You can adjust the brightness with LUX + and -, and resync the time by pressing A.

### CO2

[co2.py](co2.py)

Add a [SCD41 sensor breakout](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/scd41-co2-sensor-breakout) to make an unsubtle carbon dioxide detector. Press A to reset the high/low values.

### Eighties Super Computer
