## Image transfer instructions

### image_gallery.py

Copy the images to your Pico W using Thonny.

### image_gallery_sd.py

Pop an SD card into your computer to copy the images across. (Alternatively, you can transfer them using Thonny, but you will have to mount the SD card using the REPL first).

This example requires `sdcard.mpy` from `common/lib`  - copy this file into `lib` on your Pico W.
