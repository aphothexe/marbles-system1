# This example reads the voltage from a LiPo battery connected to Pimoroni Pico LiPo
# and uses this reading to calculate how much charge is left in the battery.
# It then displays the info on the screen of Pico Explorer.
# With Pimoroni Pico LiPo, you can read the battery percentage while it's charging.
# Save this code as main.py on your Pico if you want it to run automatically!
