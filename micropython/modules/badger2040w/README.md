# Summary

## Differences between Badger 2040 W and Badger 2040

Badger 2040 W switches from the Badger-specific drawing library of Badger 2040, to our generic PicoGraphics library.

PicoGraphics brings some great improvements, such as JPEG support with dithering and cross-compatibility between all of our other display products.

We've tried to make the transition as simple as possible, but there are a few breaking changes you'll need to be aware of:

* `pen()` is now `set_pen()`
* `update_speed()` is now `set_update_speed()`
* `thickness()` is now `set_thickness()` and *only* applies to Hershey fonts
* `image()` and `icon()` are deprecated, use JPEGs instead.
* `invert()` is not supported.

See the [PicoGraphics function reference](../picographics/README.md) for more information on how to draw to the display.

Additionally Badger 2040 W does not have a "user" button since the BOOTSEL button (which originally doubled as "user") is now aboard the attached Pico W.

## Getting Started

:warning: If you're using the examples-included firmware you're good to go, otherwise you'll need to copy `examples/badger2040w/lib/badger2040w.py`, `micropython/examples/badger2040w/WIFI_CONFIG.py`and `examples/badger2040w/lib/network_manager.py` over to your Badger 2040 W.

To start coding your Badger 2040 W, you will need to add the following lines of code to the start of your code file.

```python
import badger2040w
badger = badger2040w.Badger2040W()
```

This will create a `Badger2040W` class called `badger` that will be used in the rest of the examples going forward.

## Constants

Below is a list of other constants that have been made available, to help with the creation of more advanced programs.

### Screen Size

* `WIDTH` = `296`
* `HEIGHT` = `128`

### E Ink Pins

* `BUSY` = `26`

### Power Pins

* `ENABLE_3V3` = `10`

### Activity LED Pin

* `LED` = `22`

# Function Reference

## Basic Drawing Settings

Since Badger 2040 W is based upon PicoGraphics you should read the [PicoGraphics function reference](../picographics/README.md) for more information about how to draw to the display.

### Pen Colour

There are 16 pen colours - or "shades of grey" - to choose, from 0 (black) to 15 (white).

Since Badger 2040 W cannot display colours other than black and white, any value from 1 to 14 will apply dithering when drawn, to simulate a shade of grey.

```python
set_pen(
    colour  # int: colour from 0 to 15
)
```

### Pen Thickness

:warning: Applies to Hershey fonts only.

Thickness affects Hershey text and governs how thick the component lines should be, making it appear bolder:

```python
set_thickness(
    value  # int: thickness in pixels
)
```

## Displaying Images

Badger 2040 W can display basic JPEG images. They must not be progressive. It will attempt to dither them to the black/white display.

To display a JPEG, import and set up the `jpegdec` module like so:

```python
import badger2040w
import jpegdec

badger = badger2040w.Badger2040W()
jpeg = jpegdec.JPEG(badger.display)
```

`badger.display` points to the PicoGraphics instance that the Badger2040W class manages for you.

You can open and display a JPEG file like so:

```python
jpeg.open_file("/image.jpg")
jpeg.decode(x, y)
```

Where `x, y` is the position at which you want to display the JPEG.

## Updating The Display

### Update

Starts a full update of the screen. Will block until the update has finished.

Update takes no parameters, but the update time will vary depending on which update speed you've selected.

```python
badger.update()
```

### Clear

Before drawing again it can be useful to `clear` your display.

`clear` fills the drawing buffer with the pen colour, giving you a clean slate:

```python
badger.clear()
```

### Partial Update

Starts a partial update of the screen. Will block until the update has finished.

A partial update allows you to update a portion of the screen rather than the whole thing.

That portion *must* be a multiple of 8 pixels tall, but can be any number of pixels wide.

```python
partial_update(
    x,  # int: x coordinate of the update region
    y,  # int: y coordinate of the update region (must be a multiple of 8)
    w,  # int: width of the update region
    h   # int: height of the update region (must be a multiple of 8)
)
```

### Update Speed

Badger 2040 W is capable of updating the display at multiple different speeds.

These offer a tradeoff between the quality of the final image and the speed of the update.

There are currently four constants naming the different update speeds from 0 to 3:

* `UPDATE_NORMAL` - a normal update, great for display the first screen of your application and ensuring good contrast and no ghosting
* `UPDATE_MEDIUM` - a good balance of speed and clarity, you probably want this most of the time
* `UPDATE_FAST` - a fast update, good for stepping through screens such as the pages of a book or the launcher
* `UPDATE_TURBO` - a super fast update, prone to ghosting, great for making minor changes such as moving a cursor through a menu

```python
set_update_speed(
    speed  # int: one of the update constants
)
```

## LED

The white indicator LED can be controlled, with brightness ranging from 0 (off) to 255:

```python
led(
    brightness  # int: 0 (off) to 255 (full)
)
```

## Buttons

Badger 2040 W features five buttons on its front, labelled A, B, C, ↑ (up) and ↓ (down). These can be read using the `pressed(button)` method, which accepts the button's pin number. For convenience, each button can be referred to using these constants:

* `BUTTON_A` = `12`
* `BUTTON_B` = `13`
* `BUTTON_C` = `14`
* `BUTTON_UP` = `15`
* `BUTTON_DOWN` = `11`

Additionally you can use `pressed_any()` to see if _any_ button has been pressed.

## Waking From Sleep

### Button Presses

When running on battery, pressing a button on Badger 2040 W will power the unit on. It will automatically be latched on and `main.py` will be executed.

There are some useful functions to determine if Badger 2040 W has been woken by a button, and figure out which one:

* `badger2040w.woken_by_button()` - determine if any button was pressed during power-on.
* `badger2040w.pressed_to_wake(button)` - determine if the given button was pressed during power-on.
* `badger2040w.reset_pressed_to_wake()` - clear the wakeup GPIO state.
* `badger2040w.pressed_to_wake_get_once(button)` - returns `True` if the given button was pressed to wake Badger, and then clears th
