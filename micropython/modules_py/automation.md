## Automation Classes

The `Automation2040W` and `Automation2040WMini` classes deal with the initialisation of each of the board's functions. To create one, import the `automation` module, then define a new `board` variable:

For Automation 2040 W:
```python
import automation

board = automation.Automation2040W()
```

For Automation 2040 W Mini:
```python
import automation

board = automation.Automation2040WMini()
```

From here, all features can be accessed by calling functions on `board`. In addition, when using Qwiic / Stemma QT devices, the I2C channel to use can be accessed with `board.i2c`.

Automation 2040 W Mini has the same pinout as Automation 2040 W, but with fewer inputs, outputs and relays.


### User Switches and LEDs

Automation 2040 W has two handy switches onboard with neighbouring LEDs, offering a tactile way to interact with your program and be notified of actions that need attention.

To read one of the switches, call `.switch_pressed(switch)`, where `switch` is a value from `0` to `.NUM_SWITCHES - 1`. This returns `True` when the specified switch is pressed, and `False` otherwise.

To set a switch's neighbouring LED, call `.switch_led(switch, brightness)`, where `switch` is a value from `0` to `.NUM_SWITCHES - 1`, and `brightness` is either `True`, `False`, or a number from `0.0` to `100.0`.


To make it easier to use a specific switch or its LED, the `automation` module contains these handy constants:
* `SWITCH_A` = `0`
* `SWITCH_B` = `1`


### Connectivity LED

In addition to the Switch LEDs, Automation 2040 W has a user-controllable connectivity LED near the top-right of the board.

To set this led, call `.conn_led(brightness)`, where `brightness` is either `True`, `False`, or a number from `0.0` to `100.0`.


### Actuating the Relays

Three relays are featured on Automation 2040 W (one on the Mini version). By default these are in a released state, which connects the terminal labelled `NC` to `COM`. By actuating them, a connection from `NO` to `COM` can be made instead.

A relay can be actuated by calling `.actuate_relay(relay)`, or released by calling `.release_relay(relay)`. Additionally the actuated state can be set by providing a boolean to the `actuate` parameter of `.relay(relay, actuate)`.

The state of each relay can be read by calling `.relay(relay)`. This returns `True` if the relay is actuated, and `False` if it is released. The actuation state is also reflected by LEDs that neighbour each relay.

For all these functions, `relay` is a value from `0` to `.NUM_RELAYS - 1`. To control a specific relay, the `automation` module contains these handy constants:
* `RELAY_1` = `0`
* `RELAY_2` = `1`
* `RELAY_3` = `2`


### Setting the Outputs

Three sourcing outputs, capable of PWM at up to 2A, are present on Automation 2040 W (two on the Mini version).

An output can be controlled by calling `.output(output, value)`, where `output` is a value from `0` to `.NUM_OUTPUTS - 1`, and `value` is `True`, `False` or a number between `0.0` and `100.0`

The state of an output can be read by calling `.output(output)`, where `output` is a value from `0` to `.NUM_OUTPUTS - 1`. This returns `True` if the output is on by any percent, or `False` if it is off. The state is also reflected by LEDs that neighbour each output terminal.

To control a specific output, the `automation` module contains these handy constants:
* `OUTPUT_1` = `0`
* `OUTPUT_2` = `1`
* `OUTPUT_3` = `2`


#### Reading as a percentage

If you prefer to know the current PWM setting of an output as a percentage, this can be accessed by calling `.output_precent(output)`, where `output` is a value from `0` to `.NUM_OUTPUTS - 1`. This will return a float between `0.0` and `100.0`.


#### Changing the frequency

The PWM frequency of the output can be set by calling `.change_output_freq(output, freq)`, where `output` is a value from `0` to `.NUM_OUTPUTS - 1` and `freq` is a frequency in Hz between `10.0` and `1000.0`. Values outside of this range will cause a `ValueError`.


### Reading the Inputs

Automation 2040 W has four buffered digital inputs (two on the Mini version). These can be read by calling `.read_input(input)`, where `input` is a value from `0` to `.NUM_INPUTS - 1`.

To read a specific input, the `automation` module contains these handy constants:
* `INPUT_1` = `0`
* `INPUT_2` = `1`
* `INPUT_3` = `2`
* `INPUT_4` = `3`


### Reading the ADCs

Automation 2040 W has three analog inputs, capable of reading up to 40V. The voltage on these can be read by calling `.read_adc(adc)`, where `adc` is a value from `0` to `.NUM_ADCS - 1`.

To read a specific adc, the `automation` module contains these handy constants:
* `ADC_1` = `0`
* `ADC_2` = `1`
* `ADC_3` = `2`


### Extra GPIOs

On the left hand side of Automation 2040 W are three GPIO pins. These are 3.3V logic only, and are connected to GP0, GP1, and GP2 of the Pico W. These pins can be referenced in code using `0`, `1`, and `2`, or by one of these handy constants on the `automation` module:
* `GP0` = `0`
* `GP1` = `1`
* `GP2` = `2`

There is also a `.NUM_GPIOS` for times when any iteration needs to be performed.


### Software Reset

If there is a need to put Automation 2040 W back into a known safe-state, without resorting to the hardware reset switch, then `.reset()` can be called. This deactivates all outputs, releases all relays, and turns off all user-controllable LEDs.
